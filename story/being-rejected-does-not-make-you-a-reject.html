            <p class="article-paragraph"><b>Getting a rejection is never easy.</b> You put a lot of effort into something, only to know that you are not good enough. 
                Sometimes it feels like all those efforts went down the drain.</p>
            <center><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/10.jpg"></img></center>

            <p class="article-paragraph"><b>But everyone will face rejection in life.</b> It might be when we are looking for a job, 
                applying for grad school, or as simple as asking for a favour. 
                <b>Rejection is not something that we can avoid,</b> it just happens.</p>
            <center><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/11.jpg"></img></center>

            <p class="article-paragraph">And since it is inevitable, you should <b>look at rejection as something you have to go through.</b></p>
            <center><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/12.jpg"></img></center>

            <p class="article-paragraph">When we see rejection as an everyday occurrence, it is not as scary anymore. 
                Rejections are just a step we have to take to achieve our goals. <b>It's just a part of the process.</b></p>

            <center><br><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/14.jpg"></img></center>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Lastly, don't try to suppress your emotions when you got rejected. 
                But don't be too emotional, <b>do it just enough.</b> It's okay to let it surface, <b>we are human after all.</b></p>
            <center><br><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/15.jpg"></img></center>

            <p class="article-paragraph">So the next time you got rejected, <b>be proud.</b> You made your first step, you tried, 
                and you learned something along the way. Sure, you aren't there yet, 
                but you are one step closer towards your goal. </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph"><b>And that's better than not trying at all.</b></p>
