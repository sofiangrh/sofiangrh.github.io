            <p class="article-paragraph">Sometimes other people say that we are not good enough, <b>making us feel like we'll never be good enough.</b></p>
            <center><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/2.jpg"></img></center>

            <p class="article-paragraph">We listen to what people say about us at face value. And when they left, <b>their limiting beliefs held us back because we believed.</b></p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">These experiences happened when <b>we were young and na√Øve</b>, most of the time.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">That is why we doubt ourselves to the point of believing that we can't improve ourselves even if we try.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Yet, we forgot that we've built the knowledge to break through 
                those chains over the years. <b>We made mistakes, but we learned.</b></p>
            <center><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/5.jpg"></img></center>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph"><b>Maybe back then, we couldn't, but we can do it now.</b></p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Because what's keeping us is not our lack of skills or experience. But <b>the trauma that we got because somebody decided to say that we are not good enough.</b></p>
            
            <center><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/6.jpg"></img></center>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Because we accept the idea that they projected to us, <b>the idea that we will never be good enough.</b></p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">So here's your sign to <b>break the "chain" and move on.</b></p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Or slowly pry them open because it's not always easy to break those chains and let go. <b>It's okay to take it slow and easy.</b></p>

            <center><img class="img-post" src="../assets/img/post/7.jpg"></img></center>
            <p class="article-paragraph"><b>But remember this.</b></p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">You are better than you were before.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Your future is not limited to what others tell you.</p>
